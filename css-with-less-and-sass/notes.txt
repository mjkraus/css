	* values that are defined once and then re-used throughout a style sheet

* No way to define and re-use common style rules

* No way to make minor adjustments by customizing style rules with different values

* No way to perform calculation on-the-fly

* CSS syntax can get pretty unruly for non-trival sites and styles
